# FinanceTracker
This repository of mine contains the scripts I used to help automate my finance tracker.

To use this set of scripts:
1. Go to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lOLJWvCQ9dfMVBfi1pTUhMr7z4-Iw5Wrj7YAsJJ4owY/edit?usp=share_link and create a copy.
2. Under "Extensions", open Apps Script
3. Copy the contents of financeScripts.js into the .gs file you are brought to on load.

After doing the above steps, you are good to start using the tracker! Feel free to add, modify, and remove any of the categories, and personalize the analysis sheet.

For a guide on how this tracker works, see my website: https://nathangs6.github.io/pages/financetracker.html
